1- I made the project totaly same like sample task, but added some extras.<br>
2- I used useState, useEffect, useParam, useNavigate. <br>
3- For extra, I added Login and Register buttons with a firebase file. You can use halilibrahim.soyman@gmail.com as a user and 123456 <br> as a password or you can register with your email. I keep them in firebase.<br>
4- I added two assets as extras. I also added the company's icon.<br>
5- All of task is done. You can create a new product with plus icon or delete it with delete button or click a product and see details.<br>
6- You didn't mention about delete button position so i made it manually.<br>
7- In main page, filter button is active. You can filter products.<br>
8- Also, I use Bootstrap, regular css, css module for styles.
9- Finally, I used .env and deploy project with Heroku. I hope you like it. Please share your opinions with me about it. <br>
10- I could add more extras but i didn't want to lose main project path. Thank you!<br>


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
